Prevent Tachiyomi and Mihon from throttling your requests by ignoring rate limits.
 
## Features

* Ignore extension-specific rate limits (makes page loading and browsing faster).
* Increase max number of concurrent downloads from 2 to 16.

## Supported versions

The minimum supported version is Tachiyomi v0.12.0. It might be compatible with older releases, but that is not guaranteed to work.

This was tested up to Mihon v0.16.3.
